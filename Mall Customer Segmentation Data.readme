# ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This is a machine learning project where I applied **K-Means Clustering** to segment mall customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. This kind of analysis helps businesses understand customer groups and target them more effectively.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

As an economics graduate and aspiring data analyst, I created this project to showcase my understanding of **unsupervised learning** techniques using Python. This type of segmentation is widely used in **marketing analytics** and **consumer behavior analysis**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle â€“ Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- **Features Used**:
  - Age
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1â€“100)

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Steps

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Feature Selection
3. Elbow Method to find optimal K
4. Applying K-Means Clustering
5. Visualizing Customer Segments

---

## ðŸ“Œ Insights & Observations

- Customers were grouped into **5 distinct clusters**.
- Each cluster represents a different kind of spending behavior (e.g., high income + high spenders, low income + low spenders).
- These insights could help businesses **optimize marketing strategies** and **personalize customer engagement**.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to use **K-Means clustering** for real-world segmentation
- Importance of **EDA** in understanding the dataset
- How to communicate insights with **visualizations**
